# **Next Word Predictor**

This model was created as part of a one-week long take home assignment.
The challenge was to create a next word prediction model using the pretrained Universal Sentence Encoder.

## **Server Repository**

All the TensorFlow code for training the model is found in train.py in this repository.
However, the model is hosted on a Google App Engine project I made last December.
The repository for this project can be found on my GitHub at this link
